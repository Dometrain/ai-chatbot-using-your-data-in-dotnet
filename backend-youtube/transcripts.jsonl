{"channelName":"Train To Code","videoTitle":"Is C# worth learning in 2023?","transcript":"so you like statically typed programming languages and you see a lot of jobs advertised for c-sharp developers and there are so you might be asking yourself is this a good language to learn well in today's video that's the question that we're going to answer I'll take you through some of the history of c-sharp so that you have a little bit of context and then we'll look at the different applications of the language we'll look at some of the current trends we'll be comparing c-sharp to some other programming languages and I'll leave you having answered the question is it worth you learning this [Music] c-sharp was released in 2002 and it was developed by Microsoft as a part of its dot-net initiative the original goal of c-sharp was to create an object-oriented programming language that would be easy to use and would run on the Microsoft platform C sharp is part of the C family of programming languages so basically it has curly brackets and semicolons and it was of course heavily influenced by C plus plus and indeed the sharp sign is apparently two pluses underneath each other like that I'm told anyway c-sharp code is compiled into an intermediary instruction language which is then executed it using just-in-time compilationin.net so in that respect it's fairly similar to Java Java is executed using just-in-time compilation on the Java virtual machine in fact for a long time people rather rudely referred to c-sharp as Microsoft Java but at some point these two languages began taking very different parts Java started to become less sought after as other jvm languages came out with more modern feature sets and C sharp surprisingly actually started to become more appealing as things like functional programming and parallel programming became popular Microsoft was very proactive about updating the c-sharp language to add all of these things in and keep it up to date and that's why there's two different ways to start an async task in C sharp and there's two different ways to map an array and that sort of thing it's because the languages had features added to it while still remaining backwardly compatible the main factor behind c-sharp's Evolution into a more modern programming language however was undoubtedly Microsoft decision to build a cross-platform compiler you see up until 2014 the main way to run c-sharp was on.net framework and that had to be run on Windows there was a separate open source effort to make a cross-platform compiler called Mono but for most developers writing c-sharp meant running Windows and then in 2014 Microsoft completely rewrote the.net compiler and they made it all open source under the non-profit.net foundation and they also made it entirely cross-platform and this was a real signal for Microsoft that they were going to start embracing the open source Community instead of fighting against it and that's an attitude that would eventually see them go on to acquire GitHub but anyway back to c-sharp so this new cross-platform version of.net was originally called.net core and it's now just called.net and it really does run just as well on Linux machines as it does on Windows Microsoft accompanied this with the new CLI tools and a new cross-platform IDE called Visual Studio code you might have heard of that and ultimately this is the modern world that c-sharp developers live in you no longer have to write c-sharp applications on the Windows machine and run them on a Windows server you can write C sharp on a Mac if you want to and then containerize it with Docker and then deploy it to a Linux box on AWS if you want to and plenty of people do that there are four main things that people use c-sharp to build and this is important if it's a language that you're considering learning firstly back-end web applications there is this web framework called asp.net that uses c-sharp as the language and it has controllers and middleware and all of the things you'd expect from a modern web application framework asp.net uses something called Razer pages to render HTML templates on the server it looks like this with these tags to embed c-sharp code into the template and to do conditional rendering and stuff like that the second application of c-sharp is the unity game engine Unity is an extremely popular game engine that is used to create more than half of all mobile applications and the unity scripting API is generally used with C sharp the third application for c-sharp is a framework called xamarin xamarin is a fairly mature mobile framework for creating cross-platform and Native mobile applications in C sharp if you're considering loading c-sharp to expand your career options then xamarin is worth knowing about because there are a lot of demand for mobile app developers using xamarin and lastly there's an emerging application of c-sharp and that's for building front-end web applications with webassembly and that's called Blazer now Blazer is still rather in its infancy and widespread use of it is yet to be seen But if you want to get into webassembly and you're considering c-sharp then Blazer is certainly something I would take a look at it definitely works very well and it can be a lot of fun to play around with it so those are the four main use cases for c-sharp that you need to be aware of if you're considering this as a language to learn so back to the title of this video is c-sharp a language worth learning well in so much as every new language you learn will expand your knowledge of software engineering as a whole it will expose you to new ways of solving problems it will expose you to new patterns new syntax new applications and so with that in mind then yes absolutely c-sharp is worth at least experimenting with and learning a little bit of you can find some excellent c-sharp tutorials on Microsoft's website itself Link in the description below but here on train to code I'm going to be posting a few videos over the coming weeks about c-sharp so look out for those videos with a purple background in a thumbnail and I'll also make a YouTube playlist which will be linked below to get notified of my c-sharp videos you will of course need to subscribe to this channel so do that now and leave any comments or suggestions in the comments section below that's all from this video so until next time goodbye foreign [Music]"}
{"channelName":"Train To Code","videoTitle":"Is MAUI the End of Xamarin?","transcript":"hi there I'm James and today we're going to look at framework from Microsoft that looks set to replace xamarin and that's called Maui Maui is an acronym and it's short for multi-platform app UI and that name gives us some insight into the problem that Maui is trying to solve it was released by Microsoft in May 2022 and it allows developers to build native applications for multiple platforms using a single code base so you can write your code in c-sharp and then you can deploy it to different platforms including iOS Android Windows and Mac OS now if you're familiar with mobile development you might be thinking isn't this what xamarin does and you'd be right xamarin is another framework for Microsoft that allows developers to build native applications for multiple platforms using a single code base xamarin's been around since 2011 and it was acquired by Microsoft in 2016. xamarin.forms is a popular UI toolkit that allows developers to build a shared UI across IOS and Android and this was a game changer for many developers as they can now create apps faster and with fewer resources so what's the difference between Maui and xamarin well let me show you by creating a new Maui project in order to create a Maui project in Visual Studio you need to be using visual studio 2022 version 17.3 or greater so start by opening up your version of Visual Studio 2022 and upgrading it to the latest version so I'm going to do that here from the menu and then start the upgrade now this can take a while to download and to install all of the updates so I'll just speed up this section of video for you here all right next you have to make sure that you have the multi-platform app UI workload installed so to do that open up the visual studio installer and click modify on here then down here under dot net multi-platform app UI development click that and install that so I'm going to click this modify button and just wait for this to install great with all of that installed you can open up a new project and you'll notice here that we have the Maui project type so go ahead and create a project using this and I'm going to create the selecting.net6 not.net7 just because it's a long time support version of.net so step through the wizard and this is where we can see the first major difference between xamarin and Maui unlike xamarind that has separate projects in here for each of the Frameworks that you're targeting with your build a new Maui project just has this single unified project file in the solution Explorer here if we open up this Maui program.cs file you can see it this is fairly similar to what you'll get in xamarin or in any other.net program CS file so there's this build object being created and that lets us set up dependency injection and all of that other good stuff there next if we open up this mainpage.xaml file you can see this is how we Define the user interface in Maui so there's a scroll View and then there's a vertical stack layout in here and then there's an image and a label all defined in this file here Maui uses this XML syntax that should look familiar if you've been using xamarin forms um it's also similar to how WPF applications used to be created um they used to create user interfaces on windows so hopefully this won't be an enormous learning curve for you when it comes to piecing together user interfaces if we expand this item in solution Explorer you can see here that there's a Code behind file here that contains the code for this layout in this main page class here this XML and code file pairing is also not a million miles away from how Native Android apps are created in Android Studio in fact I've done a fair bit of native Android development in the past and this XML syntax with the c-sharp file backing it here this is actually fairly similar to the activity and Associated JavaScript class that you get when you build a native Android app Java is not that different to c-sharp either so if you're coming here directly from Android development then this should have a relatively shallow learning curve as well okay so the next thing to look at is this platforms folder here this is where you have platform specific configuration for all of the platforms that we'll be targeting with our code so under Android you can see that we've got this Android manifest file also under iOS we have the info.plist property list file Visual Studio actually provides this nice configuration window for the iOS settings which is also very handy when configuring the iOS build windows down here also has an app manifest and this is for deploying your app to the Microsoft store so you know when you keep seeing that little shopping basket thing in Windows and it lets you install some programs directly from there that is the Microsoft Windows App Store basically and you can distribute your app into that as well as providing like a download link and which is a more traditional way of installing it on Windows okay if you click the drop down next to this play button you can see all the options we have for debugging our program as well I can click play on Windows and when that opens up it will tell me that I need to enable development mode on Windows to run this in debug mode so you can follow the guide that's linked here to do that if you want I'm not going to do that now I'm actually going to look at some of the other options so if you open this back up again you can see that we've got Android emulator in here as an option now if you have an Android emulator installed on your machine then you'll be able to access it from Visual Studio here and you'll be able to run your app on the local emulator and you'll see that it opens up a development version of my application now one cool thing about my apps running in development like this is that they have hot reloading so you can change something in the layout here I'm just going to change something in the UI and when you change that and save it it will instantly update in the app running inside the emulator so that's pretty cool to have this hot reloading it makes development a lot quicker when you're building things with Maui so there you have it Maui is an exciting new framework that offers some compelling improvements over xamarin but is Maui the so-called xamarin killer well it's not quite that simple while Maui does have some advantages over xamarin it's not a direct replacement for xamarin in fact Microsoft has stated that they will continue to support xamarin for the foreseeable future furthermore Microsoft has provided a clear migration path for existing Sam Moon forms projects to transition over to Maui so that means that developers that are currently using xamarin can smoothly transition to Maui when they're ready to do so you don't need to do that today that's absolutely fine it's essential to consider that Maui is still relatively new and developers May face some challenges or lack of resources compared to the more mature xamarin ecosystem but as Maui continues to evolve it's likely to gain more traction it's likely to become a popular choice for cross-platform app development so that's it from this quick look at Maui don't forget to subscribe to my channel for more videos not just on C sharp and the.net ecosystem but also on more General programming tips Frameworks career advice for software developers that sort of thing my name is James Charlesworth and why not check out the

{"channelName":"Train To Code","videoTitle":"How we fell out of love with Java","transcript":"why did Java developers wear glasses because they can't see Sharp this video is all about Java and how it went from being the absolute darling of the software development Community to that kind of ugly blanket that you keep in the back of the Wardrobe and hope none of your guests ever have to use what am I talking about I'm talking about Java Java was born in the early 1990s back when the internet was just beginning to take off that's a time that I can remember well because I'm old Java was created by James goling at his team at Sun Microsystems initially the project was called Oak and it was named after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office however due to good old trademark issues the name was later changed to Java the name Java came from the coffee that they were drinking at the time and the primary goal behind Java was to develop a language that could be platform independent in other words Java was designed to write code that could run on any device regardless of the underlying Hardware or the operating system this concept was revolutionary at the time and it encapsulated Java's famous tagline write once run anywhere so why did programmers initially fall in love with Java well one of the main reasons was it's promised of platform Independence before Java developers had to write different versions of their software for each operating system it might run on and that was not only timec consuming but it was also really prone to errors because of the testing involved in all those different environments if you ever tried to rire an Android app you'll know all about testing on different platforms so Java's introduction of the Java virtual machine changed the game entirely the jvm acted as an intermediary between the Java code and and the underlying Hardware that it was running on so that enabled the same Java program to run on any system that had a jvm installed another big advantage of java was its robustness and the various security features that it had so Java was designed with a strong emphasis on early era checking and runtime checking and it also had garbage collection which helped prevent many common programming mistakes Java's security model was also at the time really ahead of its time it had features that made it more resistant to Common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and pointer errors um and those kinds of things are really prevalent in languages like C and C++ Java's rise to popularity was meteoric by the late 1990s it had become the language of choice for web development and that's thanks to the emergence of applets applets are small Java programs that could run in a web browser and that added interactivity and dynamic content to web pages in a way that was previously not really possible back then major corporations like IBM and Oracle began adopting Java into their Enterprise applications due to its scalability and its reliability the introduction of the Java 2 Enterprise Edition j2e in 1999 cemented Java's place in the Enterprise world and it's still very well known as an Enterprise programming language j2e provides a set of specifications and guidelines for Developers for multi-tier distributed web applications and that made Java the go-to language for building large- scale Enterprise applications and that further solidified its dominance in the industry the love for Java was also fueled by the Vibrant Community and the ecosystem that was built up around it Sun Microsystems made the decision to open source a Java development kit in 2006 and that was a pivotal moment that really spurred Innovation and collaboration in the open source Community the open source nature of java meant that developers could contribute to its development and that led to a huge number of libraries and Frameworks and tools that made Java development more efficient and more enjoyable than the Alternatives at the time one of the most significant contributions to the Java ecosystem with the development of idees like eclipse and intell J idea these are tools that provided developers with powerful features like co- completion and debugging and refactoring and that made Java development much more productive and much less error prone than the Alternatives at the time Java's influence extended Beyond its own ecosystem as well many modern programming languages including C and cotlin and Scala they drew inspiration from Java's syntax and its features Java's emphasis on object-oriented programming and its memory management and its robust standard Li we set set the trend for many of the languages that followed it so in essence Java laid the groundwork for all of the modern programming languages we have today especially in the O realm despite the strong start on the widespread adoption Java's popularity has been on a notable decline in recent years look at this graph of questions tagged with Java on stack Overflow you can see they peaked about 2014 and then it's been on this steady downward Trend also according to the stack Overflow developer survey that they run every year Java has consistently slipped in the rankings over the past few surveys in the the most recent survey in 2024 it's actually down here below C++ even which is slightly ironic because that was what it was trying to improve on so what happened why did developers start to fall out of love with Java well one major factor is a rise of newer more modern programming languages so all the languages above like Java here on the list things like Python and JavaScript and go they've gained significant traction and each one of those brings something fresh and appealing to the table python for instance is love for its Simplicity and its readability that makes it a favorite amongst beginners and there's JavaScript with its dominance in web development and then go with its efficiency and its performance and also one of my favorite languages that I talk about on this channel a lot is c c in a lot of ways has overtaken Java and is now much more featur rich and nice to use language these days another reason for Java's decline is its perceived complexity so while Java was once seen as a more accessible alternative to languages like C++ it's now often viewed as a more cumbersome language compared to newer languages Java's syntax while it is quite powerful it can be really verbose and rigid and that verbosity makes coding in Java feel more like a chore sometimes especially when compared to the succinct and expressive syntax of languages like python also Java's objectoriented programming model which was once a key selling point is now seen as a bit outdated many modern languages offer more flexible approaches like functional programming and that can lead to cleaner and more maintainable code indeed there's so many functional programming features in C now that you can pretty much write an entire C application without declaring any classes or doing any oop this code here is valid C and the functions down here are doing pattern matching which is like a functional programming version of a procedural switch statement this code doesn't look like objectoriented programming at all and it's example of how C has been evolving and embracing these new methods and that's definitely not the case with Java while Java has tried to incorporate some functional programming features there's no Java equivalent to this kind of C syntax so as a result Java is seen as playing catch up rather than leading away Java's ecosystem while it's massive also has a double-edged sword to it because the sheer number of libraries and Frameworks and tools can be a bit overwhelming particularly for newcomers the abundance of tools can lead to like what's called decision fatigue where developers spend a lot more time choosing the right tool rather than actually focusing on solving a problem performance is another area where Javas face criticism while Java's performance has improved significantly over the years it's still often perceived as slower compared to languages like go or rust which are designed with performance in mind in an era where efficiency and speed a power Mount especially for large scale real-time applications that perception can be a major drawback for Java now let's talk about something a bit more intangible coolness right in the world of technology Trends and perceptions actually matter a lot more than people give them credit for Java For Better or Worse has become associated with large Legacy Enterprise systems it's the language of big Banks and big insurance companies and massive corporations so while that speaks to its reliability and its robustness it doesn't exactly scream Innovation or excitement if you contrast that of languages like Python and JavaScript which are often associated with startups and cutting Ed technology and Rapid development these languages are seen as much more agile and much more adaptable and they fit that modern developers desire for quick iteration and quick experimentation the association with Legacy systems has given Java a bit of sort of uncool reputation especially among younger developers who are looking to work on the next big thing rather than maintaining old system also the pace of innovation in the Java Community has been relatively slow so while the Java ecosystem is extensive significant updates and features have historically been few and far between with Java the introduction of new versions of java often involve a long wait and the updates while they're quite big they don't always keep Pace with the rapidly changing needs of the development community in contrast languages like JavaScript and python they have vibrant communities that push for rapid and continuous Improvement and that makes them feel a lot more Dynamic and a lot more in tune with the current technological landscape in my personal opinion the decline in Java's popularity isn't just about the language itself it's about the shifting landscape of technology and the evolving needs and the preferences of developers Java is a powerful and capable language but it has struggled to shake off that image of the language of the past it's reliable but in a world that prizes agility and Innovation reliability alone isn't enough to stay on the top developers today are looking for languages that are not only powerful but are also flexible and they're easy to learn and they're fun to use none of those really apply to Java they want to be part developers want to be part of vibrant communities that are pushing the boundaries of what's possible and while Java still does have a place in the programming World especially in these big Enterprise environments it hasn't quite managed to capture the imagination of the new generation of developers in the same way as languages like python JavaScript and go so there you have it those are basically the reasons why javascript's seen a decline in popularity and why developers have started moving towards other languages if you disagree with anything I've said or if you have your own opinions then do write me a comment below I'd love to discuss this with people that watch my videos like you but until next time my name is James and why not check out some of my other videos here on the train code YouTube channel"}
{"channelName":"Train To Code","videoTitle":"Functional programming in C#","transcript":"hi everyone today I'll show you how you can Implement functional programming in c if you haven't watched my video on the five rules of functional programming then go ahead and watch that first because everything we're going to discuss today will make a lot more sense if you watch this first functional programming is one of those programming paradigms that has a lot of theory behind it it can trace its roots all the way back to the 1930s with the Inception of Lambda calculus however we're not going to get too m in history today the main thing you need to know is that functional programming treats computation like a mathematical function so there's no side effects just pure results based on input some pretty impressive languages have been designed entirely around these functional principles for example lisp which is considered the grandfather of functional languages but then there's also hacel which is another popular functional language and then erlang which was built for concurrent and distributed systems and of course there's F which is Microsoft's own functional programming language anguage now C is not traditionally a functional language like f it's an objectoriented language centered around class hierarchies and interfaces and similar things like that however that doesn't mean that you can't do functional programming with C over the last few years a slew of syntax features has been added to C that make functional programming feel much more natural and integral to the language and if you Adit these features and avoid creating a load of abstract classes and things then you can actually write a significant portion of your C code using functional programming first up then let's discuss pure functions here's a pure function in C called ad which simply adds together two integer arguments you'll notice I've declared this as a static function now you don't have to necessarily declare your functions as static but I've done that here to emphasize that this function doesn't require any surrounding in context or any local object variables in order to run it so much like an instance function would need something in the parent class the static function is saying this doesn't this is on the global scope and it only operates on the inputs that are passed into it now this add function is a pure function because all it does is it returns a new value calculated from those original arguments X and Y it doesn't mutate the arguments and it doesn't produce any side effects it simply generates a new value that the the sum of those two arguments here's another example of a pure function in C this time it's operating on a string the string function is only returning a new string calculated on the arguments that are passed in so again there's no side effects here and there's no need for any external context these two functions can be declared as public or first class functions within your code and you can pass around references to these functions anywhere and you can import them into to other parts of your code so you can execute them or you can put them in a class Library like a c function library and then they can be deployed to nuget and consumed by other people's code no code inside either of these functions needs anything external to run they're pure functions and they're written in C next up we're going to look at another functional programming concept and that is immutability immutability in functional programming refers to data structures it's one of the tenants of functional programming that data structures should be treated as if they can't be changed C offers a number of features that allow us to enforce immutability on data structures so let's take a look at a few of those now C provides an immutable data type known as a record if you create a new type as a record like this then once you've instantiated it or you've assigned some data into it then the data can't be altered so this action here wouldn't be permitted by the C compiler you can still pass this record object around just as you would with a class but you can't modify the data inside of it if you wanted to change one of the properties of this record then you need to actually create a new record instance with that property altered with record types we can achieve this with the wi operator so this statement here means copy all of the properties from this record and merge in this object on the right hand side let's consider a more practical example so initially we have a more objectoriented approach where there's a user class here with a mutable name property now let's say that we had a function to change this user's name so this function change username it takes the user class and the new name as parameters now because this is objectoriented and not purely functional in here we can simply assign user.name equals new name so therefore we're mutating the user class to update the name now let's rewrite this code into a more functional style that utilizes pure functions and immutability instead of a user class we'll use a user record so we create a new record called user with the same properties on here so that's now an immutable data structure so because this is immutable it isn't possible to change the name property after the records being instantiated so you couldn't pass an instance of this back into the same function that we used before so the function can't be called change username so instead we're going to create a new function and we're going to call it with new name this function will have to return a new version of the record with the name field altered so we're passing in this user which won't be changed but we're returning a new version of the user that has the name property updated so in here we can do return user and then with and name equals new name so that gets merged into the return result this syntax is reminiscent of the spread operator in JavaScript or typescript applying immutability like this can make your code much more predictable you know that when you pass that user object into a function the function isn't going to mutate or modify the argument in functional programming it's all about creating new results and not altering any existing state lastly we're going to discuss function composition this is where things get really interesting function composition in functional programming involves creating new functions by combining smaller functions together so we're going to build a function pipeline here in C sh by threading the output of one function into the input of another as you can see here we've got two inline functions called add one and double it the third function here composes double it and add one into a third function so if we do cons right line add one and one five this would be the equivalent of invoking double it function and then invoking the add one function we've just put those two together into one composed function so here we're treating the functions much more like you treat variables the initial example it showed an add function with two variables coming in as arguments well here with these Lambda functions or these Funk classes we're treating the functions as if they're variables again and that's a fundamental concept in functional programming where functions are treated as first class citizens just like variables or any other parts of your code that can be passed around and modified so there you have it even though C is not strictly a functional language we've demonstrated that you can definitely use functional programming techniques in your C code and if you follow this you can result in more predictable and more testable code and that makes your life as a developer considerably easier so why not put some of these ideas into practice in your own code and let me know in the comment section how you get on I'm always eager to hear your feedback and suggestions as it helps me produce more useful and engaging videos for you on the channel so until next time this is the train to code YouTube channel don't

{"channelName":"Train To Code","videoTitle":"The Ultimate Amplify vs Firebase Comparison for 2024","transcript":"Amazon web services and Google Cloud platform two of the most widely used Cloud platforms around today and both of these platforms offer framework that make consuming their cloud services in your application a lot easier on AWS that framework is called amplify and on Google it's called Firebase in this video I'm going to compare these two in the following categories we're going to compare their features and then devx that's the developer experience of using each library then documentation support and that also includes Community Support then pric learning curve and lastly we'll assess the future outlook of these two Frameworks what does their product road map look like and where do we think they'll be in a few years time now a quick disclaimer before we start if you are choosing between amplify and Firebase you're really choosing between AWS and Google cloud and there's a bunch of other considerations you should be aware of When comparing these two Cloud Platforms in general but for this video we are focus on how these Cloud platforms can integrate into your application using their corresponding Frameworks firstly though let's have a quick look at how you use them both in a JavaScript web application so both of these have a CLI tool that you can install locally in node.js and that guides you through the setup in your application for amplify you go to this page here amplify Dev Center and you go setup amplify CLI and you can see here we've got instructions of how to install it globally as an mpm package so we'd run that in the console and then we'd go through these setups here to run amplify configure and what that will do is if I scroll down this page a bit that will let you log into your AWS account and get some credentials and set up a user that you can use with amplifier from the CLI that talks to your AWS cloud account once you've got this set up you can then scroll to the bottom here and run this command amplify in it and that will create a new amplify application in your current directory and that's how you use it in a JavaScript project once you've got that set up there's a bunch of commands that you can run and you can do things like amplify ad or and that will add authentication into your project amplify ad analytics that will add analy itics and your applications are so you build up the features in amplify by running these amplify commands and that all adds in extra pieces of javascripts and extra Snippets into your application Firebase on the other hand has something fairly similar the Firebase CLI is here and just like with amplifier you install that as a global mpm package with mpm installed DG Firebase tools and then you do the similar sort of thing where you connect to your Google account and it's got again a bunch of commands that you can run so you can use things like amplify uh sorry Firebase in nits and then you've got Firebase uh apps create which creates a new Firebase app in your current project all right so as you can see amplifier and Firebase are both relatively simple to get up and running using the command line interface so let's start by comparing these two with their features amplifier and Firebase both include authentication so they allow you to set up secure user authentication with various identity providers so that your users can log into your front-end application and either amplify or Firebase will handle the all flow and they'll handle passing tokens to the various backend calls for you once your users are authenticated in amplifier this is done with a service in AWS called Cognito which you can manage in the AWS console and in Firebase this is called Firebase authentication also both these two Frameworks include analytics out the box so amplify and Firebase both have tools for app analytics including user Behavior engagement metrics and crash reporting but there are some features that are exclusive to one or the other so that's how I have to decide the winner in this category AWS amplify has a couple of things that Firebase doesn't have notably graph ql API supports graphql is a query language that lets you build flexible data queries when calling an API the idea is that your front end decides what data it needs and the back ends just Returns the requested Fields so Amplified API functionality lets you set up a graphql API that you can consume in your app and that's pretty cool if indeed you are a fan of graphql now I know not everyone one is but there you go that's not possible in Firebase out the box that's a feature that AWS has that Firebox doesn't have also one of feature that might be significant in the coming years is AR and VR support amplify lets you build applications that integrate with Amazon samarium which is a service from AWS for creating immersive augmented reality and 3D applications that integration elabs you to securely embed Amazon Samarian scenes into your web applications which is a little bit Niche but it could be a game changer depending on what happens in that space in the near future on the other side of the fence however there are some features that are exclusive to Firebase and the big one is Firebase realtime database this is the big selling point of Firebase for a lot of people to be honest realtime databases are databases that you can integrate into your web application and you make updates on the front end and then the framework will automatically propagate those updates to the server and to all other connected clients that might be looking at that data that makes realtime data database is perfect for applications that require collaboration so consider an app like Trello for example if you were to move a card on a shared Trello board on one machine that data is then saved to a real-time database and then very quickly all other connected people who are logged on and looking at that trailer board will see that update happen before their eyes and you haven't had to write any backend code for that and there really is no direct comparison for that feature on AWS amplify there are open- source implementations of real-time databases superbase is a popular one and it is of course popular to implement that on AWS but it's not directly supported inside the AWS amplifier framework of tools so you do have to use third-party packages and Frameworks and things to get that working or you need to roll something yourself so when it comes to picking a winner for this category I've got to say that that inclusion of realtime databases for me at least means I do have to hand this to Firebase for this category it's such a huge time saer to not have to build apis and things just to store some data in your application you just install Firebase and then bam you've got a database for your web app so let's call that one nil and look at our next category which is devx a good developer experience these days usually evolves around three things it should be simple to install simple to integrate into your workflow and then simple to maintain both amplifier and Firebase do aim to simplify backend development they both offer a ton of features as we've just seen and they're both actively maintained by AWS and Google respectively with regular updates being released to both however at a push Firebase is seen as the more straightforward to learn that's mainly due to Firebase focusing on being what they call a backend as a service so the idea is that by using Firebase you don't have to think about the backend at all everything is managed for you in a super simple and accessible way with much smaller scope compared to AWS AWS amplifiers integration with the Border AWS ecosystem is less about abstracting away the back end and it's more about allowing you to easily use AWS services in your application so even if you do ultimately have to do some of the management and the setup of those AWS Services yourself AWS does therefore offer a bit more flexibility even if that does come with a steeper learning curve and slightly more convoluted developer experience so I'm going to give this one to Firebase as well just because as a framework it does feel a lot more focused and targeted at one particular type of implementation next up this is the Firebase documentation and this is amplifier documentation so we're going to compare these two on documentation and Community Support I'll pop links to these two pages in the description of course but yeah they're both fine as we saw at the start the the documentation for getting the CLI set up is very comprehensive both Firebase and AWS amplify have robust ecosystems with detailed documentation and active communities around them they both have thousands of questions tagged on stack Overflow and they've both been around long enough to find multiple excellent examples of Open Source projects that people have built with each and the other other it's tough to judge this one but ultimately I think I'm going to make a call based on the most prestigious metric in the entire world and that's GitHub stars with 9.4 th000 GitHub stars on amplify and only 4.7 on Firebase only uh this time ultimately I'm going to have to give this to AWS amplify so that makes the score 2 to one all right pricing let's move on to pricing so first up both these Frameworks are free and open source but when we talk about pricing we're really talking about the cost of the services that these Cloud platforms provide and what those costs are going to end up looking like if you use these two Frameworks in your application Firebase operates on a premium model and it offers a generous free tier under their spark plan and that's quite sufficient for Building Development and smaller projects that Spar plan includes essential services such as analytics authentication and database usage within certain limits when your project grows you can switch to what they call their Blaze plan which is a pay as you go option that builds you for the resources that you use beyond that freet tier allowance firebases pricing is straightforward with specific costs and additional storage and database reads and wres function invocations and all that sort of stuff that makes it really easy to predict monthly expenses based on your application usage patterns AWS amplify similar offers a free tier and it offers a pay as you go pricing model just like Firebase the free tier on AWS includes a specific amount of build and deploy time as well but also storage on S3 and other resources that could be enough to get small projects off the ground beyond the free allowances you pay for what you use with charges based on the underlying AWS services that your application consumes such as S3 for storage or Lambda for compute this means that the cost could vary wildly depending on the complexity of your backend and how many AWS services that you integrate with so while aws's broader service ecosystem offers incredible flexibility and power it also introduces quite a bit more complexity when it comes to cost management so it requires you to have quite a good grasp of which Services you're using and how you're using them so when you're weighing up these options consider your project scale consider the expected growth of your usage and specific backend needs you might have if you're looking for Simplicity and predictability in costs especially in the very early stages of your project then Firebase might be the way to go Firebase is free tier is robust for starters and then the shift to pay as you go is pretty seamless as your needs expand on the other hand if your project expected to scale quickly or requires Lots of use of those various AWS services that we talked about that amplifier could offer more value in the long run that's despite potential steeper learning curve in managing costs personally I bu a lot of small quick projects as a way to just test out a new framework and to teach people about things and they don't get many users and for me to be honest both of these are perfectly fine and at small scales both of them will cost essentially zero so I'm going to call this one a tie but if you do of course need to measure pricing against the specific usage patterns of the application that you're planning to build now let's look at the learning curve in a bit more depth the learning curve of these platforms is a vital factor to consider especially as it significantly impacts the speed and the ease of which you can bring your project to life if you want to ship something in two weeks then it's not great if you had to spend that first week just getting your head around the framework so for Shear speed and how quickly you can learn something will directly influence how long your project takes to reach completion if you're leaning towards Firebase then you're in for a relative ly smooth ride Firebase is designed with Simplicity in mind it aims to be accessible entry point for developers into the world of back-end Services it's really is that backend as a service as they tout it to be it has a certain amount of independence from the broader Google Cloud platform which means you won't be overwhelmed with unnecessary complexity if you're not using all those additional services for many people the appeal of Firebase lies in its straightforward approach to app development Firebase offers extremely concise and clear documentation and it has that userfriendly cont console as well that doesn't mean it lacks depth but rather it allows you to dive into more complex functionalities at your own pace and that makes it a great choice if you want to hit the ground running without a steep learning curve on the flip side though AWS amplify presents a different set of challenges AWS amplify is part of the whole AWS ecosystem which is both a strength and a hurdle the strength lies in the extensive range of services and the flexibility that that offers and the hurdle is that there's a lot more there to master amplifier integrates deep with other AWS services that makes it really really good for building complex and scalable applications however that integration does mean that you're likely face a steeper learning curve especially if you're new to AWS the good news is that amplifi designed to streamline development process to an extent and it offers a suite of tools and services that support backend development from data storage to authentication to machine learning and API creation including graphql as we talked about earlier but to leverage the full use of those capabilities you do need to invest a bit more time and understanding into both amplify and also just AWS in general so ultimately I have to give this one to Firebase by basically every measure Firebase has more approachable learning curve from a standing start and you'll probably be able to get up and running with Firebase more quickly than with AWS amplifier so that's one more point to Firebase right there right lastly let's compare these based on what we think the future outlook is for them on the one hand we've got Firebase Firebase integrates well with Google cloud services that makes it a solid choice for people that want a straight approach to application development however it is worth noting that Google has a bit of reputation for discontinuing services that are relied on by thousands of users check out all these things on this page that Google has killed off over the years Google are a company that are not afraid to move away from something the minute it stops fitting in with their long-term vision of the future and while that history doesn't directly impact Firebase it is something that can't really be ignored AWS amplify on the other hand is backed by Amazon's vast Cloud infrastructure it's the most adopted Cloud platform in the world and it likely will stay that way for a few years to come so although it has a steeper learning curve compared to Firebase the investment in learning how to use amplify can pay off for projects that need those features AWS adds new Services all of the time and I think they're well over 200 Services by now that do all sorts of things from image recognition with machine learning to iot Integrations you know internet of things and stuff like that and over time it's likely that more and more stuff will be available in AWS and then you can call it from their amplifi package so I think for that reason the future is probably brighter for AWS amplify and I'm going to give this point to them so there's the final scores it's not scientific but it can tell us a little bit about these two platforms the conclusion to this kind of reminds me of the iPhone versus Android debate if you want a simple beautiful easy tolearn easy to use application then go with Firebase that's your iPhone basically but if you're willing to thinker a bit more and explore all the options then AWS undoubtedly has a much wider ecosystem of features and options that you can use there is so much right now that you can do on AWS that's just not possible on the Google Cloud platform and that's not looking like to change anytime soon so if you want that power and the breadth of services and you're willing to jump through a few more Hoops with the libraries then AWS amplifier is a super solid application framework that you can get up and running with very little prior experience if you want my honest opinion I think datase is the better designed framework and the inclusion of the real-time database is absolutely gamechanging however I can live without that and I much prefer AWS as a cloud platform in general because of all the diverse services that they've built so my own personal verdict on this is to go with AWS amplify but hey you make up your own minds and why not let me know in the comment section below which of these two you prefer while you're here also subscribe to train code on YouTube I hope you found this video useful do check out my other videos my name is

{"channelName":"Train To Code","videoTitle":"How C# and Java Are Actually Twins","transcript":"today we're looking at c-sharp and Java two of the most popular programming languages out there and I want to answer the question of how similar they are really I'll be doing that by comparing C sharp and Java to help you get a better understanding of their similarities and their differences we'll start by taking a quick look at the history of both these languages and in their primary purposes and then dive into the syntax the features and the libraries that make these languages similar by the end of this video you'll have a clear picture of how C sharp and Java relates to each other and if learning one of these can help you learn the other more easily C sharp and Java were both developed in the late 90s and early 2000s Java was created by some Microsystems and is now owned by Oracle it's aims to provide a platform independent language for web and software development c-sharp was developed by Microsoft and it was designed as part of the.net initiative to create an easy to use object-oriented language for the Microsoft platform c-sharp was actually initially referred to as Microsoft Java and that highlights some of the similarities between these two languages right from the start so let's have a look at some of the core similarities between c-sharp and Java both c-sharp and Java share a c style syntax which makes their code structure appear quite similar so this includes the use of curly braces or curly brackets as I call them to Define blocks of code and then you've also got semicolons to terminate statements similar keywords here for declaring variables and loops and conditionals for example declare an available in both languages looks like this so you've got int and then x equals five the word int is different between social and Java but it's not hugely different it's just the name of the type then the variable then equal sign additionally control flow statements so statements like if and else like we've got here these are very similar between C sharp and Java C sharp and Java are both strongly object-oriented languages and that means that they support the four key object-oriented principles so that's inheritance polymorphism encapsulation and abstraction both these languages have classes they have objects they have interfaces and they have abstract classes so that allows developers to create complex systems with reusable code in C sharp and Java you can Define classes with methods and properties and Fields and you can inherit base classes and you can Implement interfaces to define a contract for a class this shared approach to object-oriented programming makes it relatively simple for developers to apply their objects oriented Knowledge from one language into the other both c-sharp and Java are handled by garbage collectors the garbage collectors automatically manage memory allocation and deallocation so that frees up developers like you from the burden of manual memory management now the use of garbage collection helps to reduce memory leaks and it makes the code more efficient and less prone to errors so the specific garbage collection algorithms used in c-sharp and Java are a little bit different but the overall Concepts and the benefits of having that automatic memory management do remain consistent between the two both C sharp and Java come equipped with extensive standard libraries that offer a wide range of functionality from data structures and algorithms to file i o and networking and multi-threading although the specific classes and methods and namespacing and packages and things may differ between these two languages the overall Concepts and the general use are strikingly similar for example both languages provide collections like lists and dictionaries which is called a map in Java and queues understanding the standard libraries of one language make it a lot easier for a developer to grasp the libraries in the other language so that really speeds up the learning process so if you understand lists in Java you'll definitely be able to understand them in C sharp and vice versa exception handling in c-sharp and Java follows a similar pattern they both use try catch finally blocks to gracefully handle errors and exceptions this approach allows developers to create robust and thought tolerant applications by catching and handling exceptions at one time the Syntax for exception handing is nearly identical in both languages and that makes it easier for developers to apply your error handling skills across these two Frameworks or languages so by exploring these similarities in great detail it becomes clear that c-sharp and Java do actually share many fundamental concepts and structures this Common Ground allows developers experienced in one language to more easily learn and adapt to the other language I for example was an Android developer for a long time and then I very quickly moved back into c-sharp without too much headache between the two it is essential to recognize that each language also has unique features and capabilities and you do need to study those separately to gain a complete understanding of the respective power and versatility but despite the similarities there are also some key differences between c-sharp and Java so to answer the burning question RC sharp and Java similar kind of yes they share many of the similarities in terms of syntax in terms of object-oriented Concepts memory management similar libraries and similar exception handling if you're already proficient in one then you'll find it much easier to learn the other however keep in mind that there are still differences between these two languages and you'll need to explore those differences further so I hope they found this comparison of C sharp and Java helpful if you did don't forget to leave this video a thumbs up and subscribe to the channel

{"channelName":"Train To Code","videoTitle":"Deploying your C# application to AWS AppRunner","transcript":"so you've got a c-sharp web application and you want to containerize it and then deploy it to AWS you don't want to be messing around with load balances or container repositories scaling up or any of that sort of noise you just want to upload your app to AWS and let them take care of everything for you well this is the use case for AWS app Runner and in this video I'm going to show you how to deploy a c-sharp web application to app Runner with just a couple of clicks and very minimum setup [Music] is a managed service from AWS that enables the easy deployment of web applications and apis it requires little to no infrastructure to set up you simply Supply your app as a Docker image an app Runner will take care of building and deploying of applications to the cloud with automatic scaling and load balancing and if it's a web API it will create public endpoints for you and all of that it really is a fully managed service for hosting your web apps in the cloud so here's a web application that we're going to deploy this is a band website for a fictional band called the C Sharps you can see that we have an asp.net razor Pages web application with our index page here and then there's another page down here called song.cshtml and that displays the lyrics to some of our band's songs if we push F5 on it and start it up locally then you'll be able to see what I mean we just have this simple home page and then a few song lyrics listed at the bottom you can click on one of these song lyrics and that takes you to the lyrics of that song so we have two Roots that's two razor Pages plus a couple of other files for a template and an error page and so on now this is the site that we're going to deploy to AWS app runner in order to do this there are two things that you're going to need you're going to need Docker because we're going to be deploying this in a container and you'll need the AWS toolkit for visual studio now you don't strictly need the AWS toolkit you can of course use the command line but um the AWS toolkit really does make it the whole process a lot more visceral and it just certainly makes it a lot easier for me to demonstrate it here so if you're going to be doing an AWS development in Visual Studio then you really should get the toolkit anyway as it has loads of other really useful features that you will find invaluable to install the AWS toolkit you just navigate to this page on the visual studio Marketplace and download install the toolkit extension the link is of course in the video description below once you've got this extension installed you'll be able to go into the view menu in visual studio and you'll have this new Option here called AWS Explorer AWS Explorer is a window that pops up in visual studio and that allows you to connect to and browse some of your AWS Services directly from Visual Studio it's also got this credentials manager here so if this is the first time you're installing this then you'll need to set it up with some of your AWS credentials I have my credentials stored in a profile called train to code and that's in the AWS configuration file on my machine there's another Link in the description that details how to set up your AWS credentials WDS Explorer is a good way to test if you're made up to credentials are set up and working okay you should be able to open up some of these items and see the services that you have deployed as you can see here I've got a couple of AWS Lambda functions deployed to my AWS instance and I can see those in the explore window there the other thing you will need for this is Docker now I've put a link in the video description for where you can download Docker desktop from but it's fairly self-explanatory there isn't a huge amount of setup with Docker you'll just need to restart your machine and then you'll get this Docker Desktop Windows application here if of course you're on Windows you can also install it on Mac and Linux right now you have Docker installed and running and you have the AWS toolkit for visual studio you can next open up the solution and right click the project name in here and then from there you can select this new menu option called publish to AWS clicking on that gives you this AWS publish Wizard and these four options and for app fawner you want to select this bottom option asp.net core app to AWS app Runner if you don't have Docker up and running then you'll see a warning on the right hand side here under published details but I've got Docker running fines there's no errors you can just go ahead and put in an application name into this field here then this is just a close of clicking the publish button and confirming this pop-up and we are away now if you read this logs you can see it's building the docker image and then it pushes that image to ECR which stands for elastic container registry that's a place on AWS where you can store Docker images basically but you don't really need to worry about that because it's all handled for you the next stage is to configure the AWS Cloud development kit the cloud development kit is an open source software development framework to Define Cloud infrastructure in code and it Provisions it through AWS cloud formation it abstracts away many of the complex details of cloud infrastructure management and it provides a much higher level easier to use API for defining and managing your AWS Resources app planner uses the cloud deploy development kit but you don't need to actually set up yourself if you already have the cdk set up and configured then this step will go a lot quicker I'm doing this for the first time here so that's why I have to wait for this and you can see I've sped up the video a little bit here as well because this can take quite some time while this is running it's good time to remind you to subscribe to train to code on YouTube for weekly coding tips guides and tutorials I cover all aspects of web development on this channel and this video is part of a series on c-sharp so I'm adding all of these to a playlist so you can watch just the c-sharp videos if you like Link in the description below okay once that's finished you'll get this endpoint URL here this URL will end in AWS appwana.com and this is the public URL of the application that AWS has configured and set up for you and this will have load balancing and scaling and all of those things I mentioned at the start of this video so if you click on this URL and you can see we go to the website here this is the same application that we have running locally you can see these routes work you can click on one of these pages and it goes into that page on the web app but this is of course hosted on AWS now and not locally lastly let's have a look in the AWS Management console so I've navigated to app runner in the console by searching for it in the search box and you can see we have this new service here called the c-sharps service if we click on that you can see deployments and events and all sorts of things like that AWS up Runner is a good service to be aware of it simplifies the deployment of your c-sharp web applications to AWS it's fully managed infrastructure it's automatic scaling and it's got load balancing and it's user-friendly interface all make it a really useful tool for deploying applications and especially since you can do it all so easily through Visual Studio as we've seen here today so I hope this video has been useful to give you a glimpse into app runner for c-sharp applications as always please do check out my other videos on my channel my name is James Charles and I'll see you in the next C sharp video in this series foreign [Music]"}
{"channelName":"Train To Code","videoTitle":"TypeScript vs Javascript - Which is better for learning to code?","transcript":"most people that are learning front-end web development learn JavaScript and why not right it's the most popular front-end web development language it's just about the only language the browsers can understand natively and run the internet is full of guides and tutorials and walkthroughs on JavaScript some of them indeed are right here on my channel but just because JavaScript is very common does that really mean that it is the best language to learn if you're new to web development well today we're going to look at the big alternative to learning JavaScript and that's just just jumping in and learning typescript as your first main language so first a little bit of History JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Ike who developed it while he was at Netscape Communications Corporation its initial purpose was to add interactivity to web pages over the years javascript's capabilities grew and that made it an essential tool for web development today it's one of the core Technologies of the web along with HTML and CSS JavaScript is an interpreted high level programming language it's known for being lightweight flexible and objectoriented over the years several standards have been developed for JavaScript including ECM script or ecmascript the ecmascript specification often abbreviated as es that defines a standard set of features for JavaScript so you might have come across various additions of the spec being called things like es5 or es6 or ES 20105 these are all short for ecmascript and they basically mean the JavaScript version so as we we it sites and web applications became more complex the demand for more robust tools grew and developers started looking for ways to write maintainable and scalable code and so that's where typescript enters the story typescript was introduced by Microsoft in 2012 and it's a suet of JavaScript so that means that every valid JavaScript code is also valid typescript code the main addition that typescript brings to JavaScript is optional static typing static typing can help catch errors early in the development process and that can provide improved tooling for developers so you can get things like better autocompletion or better refactoring capabilities and more stuff like that so with typescript you use types obviously but also things like interfaces and generics and even features from future versions of xos scripts before they become standard in regular JavaScript so once typescript code is written it's then transpiled into regular JavaScript using the typescript compiler so this means that the end result is still JavaScript which can r in any browser or JavaScript runtime environment so now let's have a look at the differences between JavaScript and typescript and what that means to you if you're thinking of learning to code in one of these two languages and the big one of course is typing JavaScript is dynamically typed which means variables do not have a predefined type the type of a variable is checked during runtime typescript on the other hand offers optional static typing so that means that you can specify the type of a variable or a function or an object at compile time now I said that this is optional static typing and it is typescript has this special type called any and if you use any then you essentially remove the typechecking part from typescript and it behaves basically the same as JavaScript again so remember typescript is a superet so JavaScript code is already valid typescript code and all of the type checking stuff is optional so what's the benefit of static type checking well the biggest benefit is errors and when you're learning to code a new language you're going to have a lot of errors and that's okay but generally typescript makes errors much easier to fix the idea of using types that takes you a little bit more time to write the code in the first place but you do save a whole load more time when something goes wrong and you need to fix a bug so think more time typing code and less time staring at error messages so typescript is good for that but where is it less good well if you're just like starting to learn how to code and I think it's fair to say that typescript does have a steeper learning curve than JavaScript natively so that is you need to learn more Concepts to get working in typescript than in just JavaScript so learning about types is a big one but you probably also want to learn about objectoriented programming with typescript because having types your disposal will lead people to write code in a more objectoriented way and a lot of open-source typescript code bases are pretty objectoriented so learning JavaScript being a foundational web language might be considered more straightforward initially but with typescript there's an initial overhead to understanding the static typing and the typescript specific features but then it can offer more structur approach especially for large scale projects so in conclusion both javascripts and typescripts do have their merits for someone new to coding starting with JavaScript can offer you an understanding of the basics of web programming but as you advance typescript can be a really really good choice to handle complex projects and to leverage those benefits of static types or you could just jump in and learn typescript right away it's much easier to just not use types and transition back into writing JavaScript than to start in JavaScript and then have to learn about types later so a lot of people that have issues with typescript it's because they've learned JavaScript first and they're having to learn new stuff so whatever you choose it's initially up to you whether typescript or JavaScript is better for learning to code is completely subjective and it depends on your goals both languages have uses in different scenarios and understanding both could be ideal but the more you learn the better you'll become at overcoming new challenges so why not just learn both and while you're at it how about checking out

{"channelName":"Train To Code","videoTitle":"Ultimate Guide to Choosing a Tech Stack","transcript":"there's no best text stack for all applications but there is a best text stack for your individual set of requirements if you follow the guidelines in this video then I will help you pick it this is one of the most commonly asked questions by Engineers when they're about to start a new project how do I choose my tech stack everyone from people leading a team of Engineers at a startup to people that just had an idea for a side project and you want to bring that to life you're going to need to start by picking a Tex act but there's a lot of misconceptions about Tex acts the internet is full of developers that are arguing for the Tex stack that they use pretty much only because it's the one that they use so in this video I'm going to try and lay out all of the factors that you need to consider when you're picking your Tex stack and I'm specifically not going to make any recommendations for any Frameworks or programming languages because there is no best set of Technologies for every project the best choice always depends entirely on the factors that we're going to talk about in this video so I'm going to say that one more time there is no Best Tex stack overall but there is a Best Tex stack for your specific project before we start though let me just quickly explain what a text stack actually is if you've been on to my website trains.com and you've seen some of my example tutorials and courses on here then you'll notice this little graphic next to each course on the right hand side this shows the text T and this is split into columns where each column has a bunch of logos in it so in this case there's a front end and there's a back end and this whole thing is your text stack so it's all the programming languages the libraries and the Frameworks and the third party services and the infrastructure choices now this image doesn't show absolutely everything that you need to build a project some stuff isn't included so things like your IDE or your operating system or your Version Control those things are generally not considered part of your Tex St so like Trello or jir for example that's not your text St but typescript absolutely is because it's a programming language react is because it's a framework that you're using and AWS Lambda is because it's the execution environment for part of your codebase now there are some famous text acts that are often described using acronyms for example there's M which stands for mongod DB expressjs react and node.js there's also lamp which is Linux Apache MySQL and either PHP Pearl or python but these are just a couple of the more well-known ones with catchy acronyms a Tex stack really could be any collection of Technologies and can be much bigger than just four things on my website train code.com I use this Tex of react typescript nextjs AWS Lambda and S3 each part of that text St is like a jigle piece that does a different thing so nextjs is used as a static site generator to generate the blog post as HTML and JavaScript that's then saved to S3 which is a cloud storage bucket on AWS then my interactive tutorials and things they're written in typescript and react now to make some of the site work I also have a few other libraries and services that I use so I use the open source Monaco Editor to make this interactive coding panel work that's a library that I'm using on the site but I don't really consider that part of the tech stack likewise I use AWS code pipeline to release changes and I use GitHub to store The Source Code but again I don't really consider those two to be part of the tech stack but you could though if you wanted to there's no strict rules on this so it's kind of up to you you could say that Monaco is part of your text a but anyway let's jump out again and talk about the process of choosing a text a for your project choosing your Tex is a process of looking at all of your project requirements and working out which features you need picking a set of technologies that allow you to build the best solution and then when you make that decision there's a bunch of factors that you really need to consider the first one is your learning curve a learning curve is a graphical representation of how your performance and a certain skill improves over time with experience or learning it shows a relationship between learning effort such as time spent learning or number of practice attempts for example and learning performance on the y- AIS so how proficient you're getting different Technologies have different learning curves so you might have a short learning curve that looks like this or you might have a longer learning curve that looks like this now it's important to point out that you don't actually have to reach the top of the graph to be able to build something with a technology so if the learning curve were JavaScript for example then down the bottom left you might have JavaScript functions and loops and variables and then at the top of this you might have really advanced stuff like the intersection Observer API or iterators and generators so stuff that's part of JavaScript development but you don't actually need to learn all that to be productive you don't need to be an absolute master in JavaScript basically to build a website so you need to assess where on this learning curve you actually needs to end up to be productive now when it comes to judging what the learning curve is going to look like for a new technology in your stack then you need to consider a few different things you need to consider how good is the documentation basically right the better documentation that there is the quicker you'll be able to learn with it maybe you could have a read through the first couple of Articles and a documentation and get a feel for how easily you understand that documentation because that will determine your learning curve in the long term also consider how similar that technology is to things that you already know the learning curve for typescript for example is significantly shorter if you already have both JavaScript and strong type language experience like Java if you only know JavaScript then the learning curve for typescript is going to be slightly longer if you don't know any programming at all then the learning curve for typescript is going to be even longer still so think about how similar a technology is to something that you already know know estimating your learning curve is really important because the quicker you go you or your team can get up to speeding a new technology the quicker you can start actually building the thing that you're going to be building so this is why some very common advice for technical Founders at startups is just to pick whatever Tex stack you're most familiar with if you pick a language that you already know extremely well then the learning curve doesn't even exist it's just a straight line upwards you already know it so this bu itself can make that technology a good choice for your stack you need to weigh up the learning curve against some of the other factors on this list and the next factor to consider is community support and ecosystem an active Community around technology can significantly impact your project success this includes the availability of libraries Frameworks tools and plugins that can extend the functionality of your core technology choices so for example on my website like I looked at the availability of the Monaco editor on my choice of react and typescript additionally a Vibrant Community means better Support options like more documentation better forums more tutorials these resources can really accelerate development and they can offer solutions to common problems they can also give you inspiration for Innovative features and ways to use that technology prioritizing Technologies with a strong ecosystem can really speed up the development of your project and it can ensure that you've got all the necessary support throughout the life cycle of your application another key factor to consider is a compatibility and the interoperability of the technologies that you choose it's essential to Select Technologies that work well together to avoid any potential bro roadblocks in your project development for example if you're considering a front-end framework that relies heavily on websockets then you need to ensure that your backend technology also supports websockets this compatibility extends to databases to thirdparty services and to any other Integrations your project might require ensuring your Tex components are compatible can prevent you making costly and timec consuming mistakes further down the line okay the next one is really important performance and cost at your target Target scale the expected scale of your application is a critical role in selecting the Tex stack that you choose you need to decide the scale that you're expecting your application to work at and then estimate the cost and performance of running the TCH stack at that scale technologies that are ideal for high traffic applications might be overkill for small projects for example the best Tex St for a platform that serves a million users per day will be very different and be priced very differently to a platform that only serves 100 users per day don't over or unen engineer your application and I'm talking specifically to Startup Founders or entrepreneurs with this advice we all have a dream that our application will one day be used by billions of people around the world but if you're building an MVP it's extremely unlikely that that mvp will still be in production when you hit anything like that scale you don't need to build an MVP that scales up 100x every year you need to build an MVP that validates your assumptions about your target market and you don't need to scale to a billion users to be able to do that so get that out of your head that scalability is the most important thing because at the end of the day scale nearly always comes with a cost attached and if you don't need Google scale then you probably don't have Google money to pay for it either so pick a solution that targets the scale that you expect at the minute rewriting code is not as expensive as people make it out to be especially in the early days of a startup and speaking of growing a startup there's another thing to consider which is team expertise so the availability and the expertise of your development team are crucial factors in selecting a tech stack if you're planning to build a team then consider the availability of skilled developers in those technologies that you're considering some technologies might have a smaller talent pool which can lead to higher hiring costs or a longer recruitment process whereas on the other hand choosing widely used Technologies might make it easier to find experienced developers so aligning your TCH St with the skills of your current or your prospective team can really accelerate and reduce the need for extensive training and this kind of goes hand in hand with the learning curve as well so a lot of available engineers and or a short learning curve is important lastly consider how future proof the Technologies are in your Tech stack the tech industry evolves really rapidly and today's leaning Technologies might not be um around in the future they might be obsolete or they might have just fallen out of fashion so it's important to consider how easy it will be to update or migrate parts of your Tex tack as new requirements emerge or as new technology evolves selecting Technologies with a strong track record of updates and a commitment to backwards compatibility and also things that have a clear road map can help Safeguard your project against being outdated that kind of foresight can help cons save considerable time and resources in the long term and it just ensures your project remains competitive in the longer term choosing the right text act for your project improves a comprehensive assessment of various factors there's the ecosystem the learning curve the performance and cost considerations at your expected scale and then also future proofing capabilities and the availability of a team carefully evaluating all these ass aspects can choose a text act that not only meets your current needs but also supports your Project's growth and helps Evolution over time by carefully evaluating all of these aspects you can choose a text act that not only meets your current needs but also supports your Project's growth and evolution over time sometimes the best technology is the one that is the easiest to replace in 6 months time we've all been there so I hope you found at least some of this video useful if you did then why not pop a comment in the comment section below and

{"channelName":"Train To Code","videoTitle":"Why C# Developers Should Learn Typescript","transcript":"hello and welcome back to my Channel today we're going to be looking at typescript specifically for those of you who are already proficient in C sharp I'll show you why learning typescript as a c-sharp developer could be worth your time [Music] c-sharp is a statically typed language developed by Microsoft and it's long been a favorite of developers because of its versatility it's sophistication and its powerful features however when it comes to client-side web development c-sharp does have certain limitations our present Blazer offers the only real way to write front and code in C sharp Blaze is great no doubt but it's not always the most pragmatic solution particularly when you need to consider cost platform support and the overall web ecosystem it's also not great if you need to work with a larger team of front-end Engineers it's not easy to hire Blazer developers to your company typescript on the other hand is one of the most popular and most sought after programming languages around today so it's incredibly easy to build up a team of typescript Developers and this is where you as a c-sharp developer have a distinct Advantage the concepts that you've already mastered in c-sharp give you a head start in learning typescript of course to really appreciate why learning typescript as a c-sharp developer makes sense it's helpful to understand the origins of typescript typescript was actually created by Microsoft in 2012 and it was the brainchild of Anders helsberg who was the lead architect of C sharp so that's why the same person who contributed significantly to our favorite language C sharp also had a major hand in developing typescript the goal with typescript was to improve secure the production of JavaScript by introducing static types over the years typescript's popularity has surged and it's become an industry standard for web development and it's used by big tech companies like slack Airbnb and even Microsoft itself when you start delving into typescript you'll find a lot of similarities with C sharp so the similarities include strong typing generics interfaces all that sort of stuff so if you're confident with these aspects in C sharp then you'll feel right at home by programming in typescript here's a c-sharp class on the left and you can see it has properties methods and a Constructor well here's the same class written in typescript they look almost identical right except for that property declaration the rest of this looks fairly similar interfaces look even more identical here's an interface in C sharp and then here's the same interface in typescript they're very similar just like c-sharp typescript also allows you to implement multiple interfaces on a class so your class can inherit functionality from the base class and then it can also Implement as many interfaces as it wants both these languages also have generics so here's a generic type parameter T being applied to both of our classes and then it's used again here in this method down here so that's referencing the type parameter that we put in extends is used in typescripts to restrict the types that can be used in a generic so just let you do that in C sharp you can do the same functionality in typescript just with slightly different syntax both these languages also support async and a weight and the usage of asynchronously is nearly identical just like this example here there are also differences between c-sharp and typescript typescript is after all a superset of JavaScript so that means it contains certain characteristics inherent to JavaScript and you'll need to get comfortable with Concepts such as Dynamic typing typescript has this any type and while it is generally recommended to avoid using this any type you will no doubt come across it from time to time when writing typescript the closest thing that c-sharp has to the any type is the dynamic type like this and if you've ever had to work with Dynamic types in C sharp then you'll know that they aren't the nicest thing to deal with on a regular basis so now let's have a look at how you can write some typescript code right now in Visual Studio hey I've got Visual Studio 2022 and it has fantastic support for typescript you can create a new typescript file in Visual Studio by simply right clicking in your product and selecting add new item then over here on the left under web and scripts you have the option to add a typescript file so I'm going to do that now then let's put some typescript code into our new typescript file I'll just do console and then Dot and you can see the intellisense pops up here and it knows about all of the properties on the JavaScript console object so that's quite nice that shows visual Studio's built-in support for typescript so I finished this line I'll just write a message to the console then if you want to get this typescript file to compile when you build your project we need to add a nuget package so go into the managing you get packages and we're going to add the microsoft.typescripts.ms build nuget package once our package has installed then just do a build of your project and you can see that when we build it that Ms build has created this compiled Javascript file from here and that's been compiled from our typescript source code it's also created this Source map file here which too which is useful for debugging so we can change this and if we were to rebuild it it would rebuild our JavaScript so there we have it learning typescript as a c-sharp developer isn't just an opportunity it's a practical move by learning typescript you'll be able to write client-side code that runs anywhere JavaScript does you'll expand your toolkit making you a more versatile developer in an increasingly web-centric world and remember you already have a head start with your c-sharp experience so thank you for joining me in this video if you found this video insightful be sure to like it and subscribe to train to code here on YouTube my name is James Charles and I'll see you next time for more tips guides tutorials on web development and general programming advice foreign [Music]"}
{"channelName":"Train To Code","videoTitle":"Serverless AI with AWS Lambda &amp; OpenAI API","transcript":"in this tutorial I'm going to show you how to build and deploy a cloud function to AWS Lambda that calls off the chat GPT to do some AI magic the code's going to be in typescript and we're going to be using serverless framework to deploy this so it's not a huge change if you don't use AWS you use Google cloud or Azure serverless framework will make this relatively Cloud agnostic so this is what we're going to be building in our Lambda function it's a simple function that can be called from an HTTP request and then that goes off and asks chat GPT to write a joke about some topic we're going to be going HTTP request Cloud function chat GPT and then back again and return the response now there's a lot of reasons Mari might want to be able to do this maybe you just want to add a bit of AI magic into your front end application so you want an HTTP end point that you can hit that will build a prompt and call the API and return the response now there's three parts to this tutorial there's going to be creating and deploying the Lambda function in typescript and we're going to be using serverless framework to help with that and then we're going to be using the open AI mpm package to call the chat GPT completions API from inside our Lambda finally we're going to test it out by making an hgp request from Postman to see this whole flow work from end to end in order to follow along with this tutorial you're going to need a couple of things first you're going to need an account with AWS so that you can deploy your code to AWS Lambda and you're also going to need an account with open AI so that you can call the chat GPT over the API if you already have both of these things then great if you haven't then pause the video and head down into the descript destion of this YouTube video where you'll find links for how to set up an AWS account how to create your credentials for deploying AWS over the CLI and there's also a link to open AI which you'll need to set up and get yourself an API key great so assuming you have both of these set up and you have your relevant credentials stored on your machine the next thing you'll need is an IDE I'm going to be using visual studio code which comes with node.js and it also has a node.js debugger which could be handy and we're going to be using the debugger for this as well then in your terminal go into a new directory and just run mpm and nit this will create a package Json file and in there you can install typescript as a Dev dependency with mpm install DD typescript you also want to be creating a m file in here for your local environment variables when you uh create an open AI account you'll get an open AI key so you want to put your open AI key into that um into the M file and then add the M file into GE ignore so here um this is to make sure that you don't um accidentally check your API key into git or anything like that okay we'll come back to the API key later on but first let's create a blank AWS Lambda function using typescript and we can deploy that to AWS and to help with this we're going to be using serverless framework serverless framework is an open source tool for building and deploying serverless applications on cloud platforms like AWS Azure and Google Cloud so the idea is to abstract away any of the infrastructure management so that allows you to focus just on the code and writing your serverless functions it also supports various plugins and extensions and it has support for typescript which we're going to be using in this tutorial now you don't have to use serverless framework you could just create a cloud formation template or even just log into the AWS console and paste the code in there but serverless framework is a super super simple way it's one of the quickest ways to get up and running with serverless programming and you can easily add more functions to this and build out an entire serverless API if you like in the future so you install serverless framework globally with MP M like this and then once you've done that you can run SLS commands on the command line like SLS -- version right so the first step is to create a basic Lambda function in typescript there's a couple of dependencies we need to add in to be able to do this so run this command here do mpm install D- saave AWS Lambda and open Ai and then we're also going to need some Dev dependencies so we're going to do mpm install DD types AWS Lambda types node and this plugin serverless plug-in typescript so create a new file called serverless.yml and I'll just quickly talk you through some of the basic Syntax for serverless framework so first thing we need to do is give our service a name we call it Lambda chat GPT and we're going to use that serverless plug-in typescript which is going to allow us to do a typescript compilation as we do the deployment next up we're going to use the M file inside our server list deployment so what this is going to do is going to allow us to use thism file that we created and it'll be accessible by process. M next we're going to say that we're going to be using AWS and we'll use a runtime node js18 and then we're going to have a stack name so serverless framework will create a cloud formation stack in AWS and this is going to be the name of the stack that it creates for us there's also going to be a region and this flag here version functions it's possible in AWS to maintain multiple versions of your code after you deployed it but we're not going to bother with that cuz that's too complicated so we're just going to turn turn off version functions which means every time we deploy this it's just going to overwrite the code that's in AWS next up we've got a deployment bucket so when this deploys it uploads a bunch of assets to an S3 bucket and our S3 bucket is going to be called my Lambda deployments and then we're going to add in this environment node which allows us to declare some environment variables which will be accessible to our AWS Lambda functions so the environment variable will be open AI key and we're going to pull that from our M file um in serverless framework you can access variables from this m file by doing n colon and then the variable name great so next up is let's create a Handler for our AWS Lambda function so what we put in here is going to be the function that gets uploaded to AWS and this is going to be the entry point for our Lambda so let's just create a basic Lambda function first we'll import the environment variables from process. MV and we're just going to create an async function call it Main and we're going to get an event from API Gateway and a context and for now let's just return a basic object that represents an HTTP status response so here we're just returning an object with a status code and an empty headers array sorry that should be process great and we need to import these two types so the API Gateway event and the API Gateway event request context are coming from the AWS Lambda types package that's just a typescript thing if you were using JavaScript you wouldn't need any of these but this is just so we can strongly type our API Gateway event API Gateway by the way is the wrapper that's going to be put around this when we call it via HTTP great so now let's go into serverless yaml and add in our new function so we're going to call our function get joke and we're going to pass in a reference to Handler so this here means take the file called Handler and take the function called main um and then by setting this URL flag to true that's going to tell AWS Lambda that we want to be able to call this function over HTTP so it's going to give us an HTTP endpoint that we can call with a URL that's why it says URL great so now let's go back into the Handler and add some actual functionality into this so I'm going to import the open AI package from the mpm package that we installed and then inside the function we're going to create a request body so that as you call this you can pull this subject from the HP request so we're going to be calling this with a Json object and that Json object is going to have a string field in it and then inside our function we're going to need to read that from the request so we do json. pass event. body what that will do is it will take the event body which will be a string and it will pause it into this type that we've just declared great now I'm just going to jump out of that Handler and create a debugger file that's going to let us debug this locally in node.js one of the problems that people find with serverless Computing and this is essentially serverless programming is it can be quite tricky to debug stuff because if you're constantly pushing your code to Lambda functions and Cloud functions then it's quite difficult to add debuggers in and attach debugs remotely so what I tend to do is just debug all this stuff locally with no JS so to do that I'm going to create a debug file um and I'm going to import my events into here and I'm going to import the main function from our Handler so that's going to allow us to declare the uh main function in here and it will allow us to call the main function from just some local debuging as an API Gateway event and it'll be asynchronous so we put some catch in here and put a debugger statement in here as well so we can pause execution if there's an error great so this will allow us to open up our launch settings in vs code and I've got a separate video up here about how to debug typescript in vs code but it will allow us to execute our debug. TS file locally in the debugger so I can actually do that now I put a debugger statement in here so if I just go ahead and hit F5 great so we stepped into here with the debugger what this will allow us to do now is locally call our main function so if we test this out we can step into here and this will step into Main and you can see we' passed in this event that's just got a body with a subject object in it so we can just check that our paing works we can check that the body gets serialized deserialized into this object with a subject and then we can return the status code there we go cool so now we've got a really really nice way of just debugging and stepping through our Lambda function locally before we deploy it to AWS so now let's go in and actually do the chat GPT stuff inside this function so this is where it gets fun so what we're going to do is just put a little bit of validation logic so if we haven't passed in a subject then we're going to return a 400 status code that's just going to say uh it's just going to have a message in there and it's just going to say invalid request so that's just to guarantee that we haven't um you know called this without any arguments or anything and then to call open AI we're going to create a new instance of the open AI class and you can see in here we're passing in the environment variable open AI key and I'm going to create a prompt for open AI that just says tell me a joke about whatever was passed in the subject so to call openai we can do open a. chat. completions doc create and we're going to pick a model I'm just going to pick GPT 3.5 turbo and in this messages array we're going to have one user message with that prompt in it and then we're going to take the result back from that GPT response which is going to be the first choice and the message and the content chat GPT always returns an array of choices and you always just want to pick the first one generally um and then that would have a message property on it and that will be a Content so the was the content of this result variable will be basically so if you're using chat GPT on the UI this is the equivalent of sending this prompt into the UI and getting this variable back so what we're want to do now is just return that result object object which we can do inside this object here in a body just return that result great so now if I step into this function again using our debugger I'm just going to push F5 and start the debugger cool so now if I use the debugger to step into our main function you can see as before we've paused this body argument and this should have the subject of trains I'll step through I'll create the new apara instance and I'm going to create a prompt that's going to say tell me a joke about trains what we're going to do now as you can see I'm awaiting this call this might take a few seconds if I just push F10 to step through this that's now going off to open AI from our debugger and it's calling the open AI completions endpoint with this prompt tell me a joke about trains and you can see that the response if I look in this result object will be why did the train go to the gym because it wanted to stay on track so we can return our result from the API end point and that's essentially the code done we're going off here we're calling open AI using our P we're getting the result back and we're returning our B in the response from this HTP endpoint great so that's a Lambda function done the next step is to deploy this to AWS so you can see here if I run this command it's going to create a cloud formation stack and it's going to deploy that to AWS so if I log into my AWS console you can see the serverless framework has created this cloud formation stack for me and if I navigate to AWS Lambda in the console you can see that we've got our new Lambda function here and if I log into the Lambda function if I open that up you can see that I've got a function URL provided for me by AWS Lambda now that function URL is what we're going to put into Postman so if I open up Postman and put in the URL and create a request body in here and my request body I'm just going to give it the topic that we want to generate a joke about and then click send you can see that's going to execute the Lambda and it's going to come back with the response from chat GPT so it really is as simple as that we've written our code we've debugged it locally and then we've deployed it to AWS all right today we've covered quite a lot of ground we've seen how serus framework simplifies the deployment process and we've created a Lambda function in typescript that integrates with the open AI package to enable our Lambda function to call chat GPT our function can now Leverage The Power of AI to generate a joke based on the input that it receives also testing this using Postman sending HTP requests and receiving the AI generated jokes in return so this endtoend test confirms our setup works when it's deployed to AWS As you move forward remember that the possibilities of this kind of stuff are endless you can modify this setup to suit a wide variety of applications before we wrap up I'd like to remind you to keep your API key secure and always follow best practices for cloud security and if you hit any roadblocks or have any questions feel free to drop them in the comments section

{"channelName":"Train To Code","videoTitle":"The Factory Method Pattern","transcript":"Factory Method Pattern The factory method pattern is a design pattern\nyou might come across when working with heavily object oriented languages such as Java or\nC#. Like with most design patterns, factory methods\nexist to add a simpler abstraction around a more complicated concept. In this video we are going to cover the problem\nthat factory methods are solving, and how they solve it. A factory is a building where things are made. And if you look at a factory from the outside\nit is usually just a generic square on a map, this is the Boeing factory in washington. If you were to actually go inside this factory\nyou'd see loads of machinery and people working away, but from the outside it's just a simple\nunassuming building. The boeing factory is what in software engineering\nwe would call a closed box, or you might hear this called a blackbox. And it's called that because the inner workings\naren't visible to the casual observer, that's us, nevertheless it still does its job of\nmanufacturing things. It hides the complicated stuff away behind\nthese four walls, essentially. And this concept of hiding away loads of detailed\nmanufacturing business inside a closed box is what's at the heart of the factory method\npattern. Like the Boeing factory, a factory method\nin your code is hiding away how something is made and presenting a much simpler interface\nto the rest of the world. And what kinds of things might you make in\na factory method? Well typically instances of objects. If you are familiar with Java or C# or typescript\nyou'll know that object oriented languages like these have the concept of an interface,\nthat can be implemented in multiple ways. So for example…. Let's say we have an IAnimal interface, and\nthen three implementations, cat dog and snake. Now at various points in our code we might\nwant to create a new instance of one of these classes. And we might have some logic that decides\nwhich class to create. We have a function here that identifies an\nanimal from some attributes. The logic might say if it barks then create\na dog, if it eats mice then if it is longer than 3 feet it's a snake otherwise it's a\ncat. Something like this. Well this kind of which object do we create\nlogic is what we are going to hide away behind the four walls of our factory. To implement the factory pattern, we create\na new function somewhere, maybe just a static function, and we have that return an object\nof type IAnimal. And put the logic in here. Now we call our factory method and say get\nme an animal with these attributes, and it executes this logic and returns some kind\nof class that implements IAnimal. And it's this return type here that turns\nour factory method into a closed box. Because remember how a real factory from the\noutside looks really simple, and all the complicated stuff is hidden away? Well that's what this function does too. The signature of this function looks really\nsimple, it just takes in some values and returns a super generic IAnimal interface, and the\ncomplicated selection logic is hidden away. So that’s the factory method pattern in\nobject oriented software design. You can extend on this to do a lot more than\njust have one factory method. Have a think about how you could abstract\naway the construction logic of your objects. Maybe you would have a class with its own\ndependencies and internal state? Maybe your factory logic would even make a\ncall off to another service or something. It’s really up to you what you do with these\nfactory methods, the purpose is to abstract away all your constructor logic in order to\nmake the rest of your code cleaner and less complicated. I hope this video has helped give you an overview\nof this pattern. For explanations of other software design\npatterns in object oriented languages, and videos on a bunch of other software development\ntopics then don’t forget to subscribe to my channel, my name is James Charlesworth\nand this is the Train To Code youtube channel."}

{"channelName":"Train To Code","videoTitle":"The most important thing for building skill as a software engineer","transcript":"in the leadup to Ireland Six Nations rugby match with England in 2009 Irish player Brian o Driscoll said this knowledge is knowing that a tomato is a fruit wisdom is knowing not to put it in a fruit salad mastering your craft is not simply a case of learning new things you need to actually learn things from different perspectives and then build up a picture of how they work together to really understand a concept and this is why I always try to tell people on this channel to learn more than one way to solve a problem take this algorithm problem for example given an array of objects where each object contains a name and a score write a typescript function there returns a new array each element in the new array should be a string formatted as name and then score where name and score are the corresponding values from each object in the imper array now off the top of the head I can think of at least two ways to solve this probably three ways we can solve this here's a couple of Solutions in typescript we have a person type to find up the top here and we need to map an array of these objects into an array of strings so what we could do is we could create a new function format array with a loop take the input array which is an array of person objects and then let's just say we've got a formatted array which is the output object and we'll Loop through using a four statement let I I is less than input array. length and then i++ and for each one of those we'll push in a result into that format in Array and looking back at the problem we want the result to be a string that says name and then the item name score the item do score then we just return that formatted array there we go that's one way of solving the problem it's fairly self-explanatory it's probably one of the first ways a lot of people would jump towards but that's not the only way to solve this let's think of another way we can solve this that takes advantage of um map in JavaScript now I've got a separate video up here about map and map and medu in JavaScript but let's just see if we can use Map to solve this in a different way so I'll create another version of this function format array with map I'm going to take in the input array again and this time I'm going to return the input array do map and then I'm going to map person to name person. name score person. score so there you go that does the same thing but without the extra variable and without the for Loop lastly we could even try a third way let's try it with a generator function format array with generator so we're taking that input array and this time we're going to Loop through it with a for Loop person of input array and we're going to use the yield statement and we're going to yield each an item in the array and so we can Loop through this and we can basically turn the format array of generator into an array there you go so three different ways that look totally different but they all do the same thing now we can sit here and argue all day about which of these is better and believe me people do argue about this kind of stuff quite a lot on the internet but ultimately that's missing the point all three of these are correct Solutions and if you want to be a wise developer instead of just a knowledgeable one you should learn all three of these approaches learn about map produce learn about generators and of course learn about for Loops the only get way that you're going to be able to make a wise and informed decision is by seeing a problem for all these different angles weighing up all the different ways of doing it discussing it with your team and then picking a solution but if you only know one of these then you're only going to have a narrow view of what the solution could be and this concept of learning from multiple angles isn't just about solving coding problems it permeates every aspect of your career in software development so consider debugging you'll often come across bugs that seem impossible to fix at first but if you approach these bugs from different angles so maybe you could start with unit tests and then use logging and then attach a debugger or even get somebody else involved and do pair programming by doing all these different things you might discover the solution a lot more quickly as opposed to just having one method that you approach every problem with each method gives you a new perspective and a different set of information about the problem also think about the different programming paradigms so there's procedural programming objectoriented programming functional programming all that sort of stuff each of these has its strengths and its weaknesses by understanding and applying them you can choose the most effective approach for each project for instance functional programming might be more suitable for a data heavy application whereas object-oriented programming might be better for applications with really complex relationships between object objects and in today's world understanding the basics of cloud computing and devops and even data science can be incredibly beneficial as well these fields intersect with software development more and more each day so learning about all this kind of stuff can open up new career opportunities and new ways to contribute to projects so you see being a well-rounded developer isn't just about mastering different programming languages or Technologies it's about understanding and embracing different methods and being able to assess them all in a wider Contex cont so by looking at problems from various angles like we've done in this code example here not only do you become a more proficient Problem Solver but you also become a more valuable team member and a more adaptable and resilient professional in the everchanging world that we live in of technology so keep learning keep exploring and remember every New Perspective and every new way that you learn to solve a problem is an opportunity for you to grow and it's an opportunity toar so why not check out this video on my channel next about how to further your career in software development until next time my name's James and this is to trains code [Music] YouTu"}
{"channelName":"Train To Code","videoTitle":"Work out your coding vocabulary","transcript":"look at these two JavaScript functions which of these do you find easier to read they both do basically the same thing but the one on top uses a for Loop and the one underneath is a generator function that uses yield all right hold that thought what about these two functions top or bottom take your pick I'll give you a moment just to read through these and decide do you find the top one easier to read or do you find the bottom one easier to read now there's no definitive right answer to which of these functions is more readable the answer comes down to one word vocabulary let me explain with a different example which of these two English language sentences do you prefer the argument was replete with fallacies or the argument was full of mistakes which of these two sentences basically would you rather come across when you're reading a book now whichever of these two sentences you prefer basically comes down to one thing do you know what the word replete means and the word fallacy if you happen to have a very wide and Rich vocabulary in the English language and you know what all of these words mean then you'll probably prefer the sentence on the top you'll probably find this sentence a bit more poetic and a bit more expressive whereas the one underneath is just basic and dull but if you have no idea what this word repete means and if that's you then don't worry you're not alone I also didn't know what this word meant until I literally used a thesaurus to create this example well if you don't know what this word means then you'll probably hate this top sentence you'll probably find it pompous or over complicated and you're probably thinking Why Can't This author just write things in simple terms the more people will understand well this is basically what happens with code as well so let's go back to that very first example the bottom function here uses some of the more advanced or less commonly used features of JavaScript so there's a generator function defined by this little star after the function name and then there's a yield statement as well now these are things are like your complicated words in your vocabulary if you understand generators and yield then it's likely that you'll find the bottom function nice ER and more expressive and maybe even easier to read but if you haven't learned generators and then you really struggle to get this you'll say it's less readable than the top one so remember it doesn't make you a bad programmer if you don't know all these more advanced language features you don't really need to know about iterators and generators to be a productive software engineer but more advanced and more senior Engineers are more likely to be fine with this bottom example and then they would even say that it's easier to read so ultimately when when you're considering readability of your code you really need to consider the programming vocabulary of the people that might be reading your code so if you work on a team of super super senior JavaScript engineers and you've all had years and years to study JavaScript and to try out all the features then sure write your code using any language feature you like so long as the browser supports it or you transpile it to something the browser supports however if you have more junior members of your team then it might be worth helping them out a bit and just using a common more widely used syn sytax there's nothing wrong with agreeing a coding standard on your team that you won't use language features that aren't widely understood if that's the most effective way for you to work together then go for it ultimately context matters a lot and the vocabulary of the people who you are asking to review your code also matters a lot as well one last thing I will add though is that personally I feel like if a language supports a feature and it can lead to more concise or expressive code then occasionally it might be worth the effort to use it and spend that extra time teaching the less experienced members of your team about that feature after all if every book you read only contains the most basic English words then how are you ever going to learn and get better at the language reading the word repete might be jarring or annoying the first time but if you take the time to pause and go and look that up in a dictionary and learn about it then you will actually learn and improve your vocabulary and this is what a lot of people do just through reading books so the same goes for code if you want to introduce more advanced language features into your codebase as a Lear learning experience for all of your teammates then as long as you don't come across as arrogant or pompous or seem like a know it all if you can approach that sensitively then maybe it's an opportunity for everybody to learn about these cool features so just try to be a team player with everything that you do anyway I'd love to know which of these you prefer ultimately so let me know in the comment section below if you've got any of your own examples you've come across then add them into the comments too and don't forget to like And subscribe to my channel here on YouTube I'm here every week with coding tips and tutorials like this this one right here on

{"channelName":"Train To Code","videoTitle":"Hello World in 15 Programming Languages","transcript":"if you've ever started a programming tutorial in a new programming language then you'll have almost certainly been shown how to say hello world this kind of program is widely used as an introductory exercise because of its Simplicity it allows beginners to focus on the fundamental aspects of the language's syntax and the setup without getting overwhelmed by complex logic or concepts writing a hello world program typically involves understanding the basic structure of a program so you might be touching functions or classes and you look at the main entry point for that programming language secondly it serves as a quick way to validate that your development environment is correctly set up being able to run a hello world program assures that your compiler or your interpreter as well as the execution environment are functioning all as expected also it's become one of those sort of weird Traditions that you just kind of have to do so in this video we're going to blast through hello world in 15 different programming languages so we're going to start with C here is Hello World in C it uses this print F function as you can see and there's an include statement and a main function declaration this is kind of neat actually because even if you've never written anything in C before these five lines alone tell you quite a lot about the programming language so they tell you how to declare a function they tell you how to return from a function and they also tell you how to import libraries into a file C is a powerful general purpose programming language it's fast it's portable and it's available on virtually every platform it was originally developed for system programming and it forms the basis for many other languages like C++ Python and Java right next up let's look at python python is a highlevel interpreted language that's known for its easyto read syntax python is widely used for web development and data analysis and artificial intelligence and scientific Computing python emphasizes readability and simplicity and that makes it an excellent choice for beginners but it is also powerful enough for complex applications hello world in Python is literally this simple it's pretty beautiful actually all right JavaScript JavaScript is a high level often just in time compiled language that conforms to the ecmascript specification so that's a core technology of the worldwide web and it's primarily used for web development to create interactive web pages so JavaScript runs natively in browsers essentially JavaScript supports event- driven functional and imperative programming Styles this is Hello World in JavaScript and it's fairly similar to our next programming language and and that is my favorite programming language typescript so look at that it's exactly the same that's because typescript is actually a superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the language and it just so happens that in this example there is no static types that we need to use typescript was developed by Microsoft and it's designed for the development of large applications and it transpiles to JavaScript typescript is appreciated quite a lot for its ability to catch errors at compile time and it has really powerful tools for large scale JavaScript applications it just make them easier to manage and easier to write okay let's go back over to the server side now and look at Java Java is a highlevel class-based objectoriented programming language and it's designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible Java is a really popular language for building Enterprise scale applications and it's known for its portability across platforms that's thanks to something called the Java virtual machine or jvm Java is widely used in Android development and also web applications and in large systems application development like I said a lot of Enterprises use Java and one language that is similar to Java is C here's hello world in C C is a modern objectoriented and types safe programming language developed by Microsoft so it's fairly similar to Java with a few more features basically C is part of the Net Framework and it's widely used for developing Windows applications but also games with unity and again Enterprise software It's relatively similar in syntax of java as you can see see here but it does actually have a whole ton of extra features that are not present in Java in fact I have a video up here on my channel called every feature on C in 10 minutes and actually this video is a lie because I probably only cover about 25% of the features that c has to offer in this video so anyway continuing on the cbed languages and it's only right that we go back and we look at C++ C++ is an extension of the C language and it often used for systems or software development and game programming C++ supports both procedural and objectoriented programming paradigms that makes it a really versatile language C++ is known for its performance and its proficient memory management this is a hell World application in C++ next up Ruby Ruby is known for its elegant syntax that's really natural to read and apparently easy to write it's a high level interpreted language used primarily for web development Ruby is used with its popular web framework called Ruby on rails and people value it for its Simplicity and its productivity hello world in Ruby is just puts which I think is short for put string but I'm not Ruby developer so I don't 100% know someone tell me in the comments below what puts actually stands for please and while you're at it why don't like And subscribe to this video next up is the language that everyone loves to hate PHP PHP is a popular general purpose scripting language that's especially suited to web development it's a server side scripting language and it was used to make things like WordPress PHP is known for its ease of use and its ability to handle complex datadriven websites but as I mentioned it is a bit of a LoveHate language and a lot of people have fallen out of love with PHP in recent years next up is go also known as goang go is an open source programming language developed by Google it's known for its Simplicity its efficiency and its great support for concurrency go is used in cloud computing and in server side applications but also in larger scale Network programming also here's Swift this is Hello World in the Swift programming language Swift is an intuitive programming language developed by Apple for iOS Mac OS watch OS TV OS and probably also Vision OS it's designed to be easy to use and to be easy to read while still being fast and efficient Swift combines the best bits of c and Objective C without the constraints of C compatibility next up we got cotlin cotlin is a statically modern programming language that runs on top of the Java virtual machine so it's developed by jet brains and it's officially supported for Android app development as well cotlin is known for its interoperability with Java and it's got concise syntax and apparently has a focus on safety also there's Pearl Pearl is a high level interpreted dynamic programming language it's often used for systems Administration and also web development but then Network programming and GUI development as well Pearl is known for its flexibility and it has powerful text processing capabilities built into the language next up is lure so lure is a lightweight high level multi paradig programming language that's how it describes itself and it was designed primarily for embedded systems and for clients lure is known for its fast execution in its small footprint and it has easy integration with both C and C++ L is very popular in game development but also in web server scripting I use lur quite a lot to write Fusion scripts for D Vinci resolve for all the animations in my videos and things so it is a pretty Niche language but it's also one of those languages that has a bunch of very diverse applications and lastly one of the most loved programming languages in the world right now and it's rust rust is a multi-paradigm programming language that's focused on safety and performance rust is syntactically quite similar to C++ but it provides memory safety without the use of garbage collection so Ross is used for systems programming and creating really high performance web applications introduction to 15 programming languages using the hello world program to tie them all together if you think I missed off your favorite programming language then do let me know in the comment section below there's a bunch I didn't do I didn't do F I didn't do Dart there's loads of other programming languages out there and if you'd like to see me talk more about any of those languages in a future video then let me know in the comments below but in the meantime why not check out this next video here for my channel and also head over to train to code.com for interactive courses and project tutorials that you can do in your browser to learn some of these languages that we've talked about so here is a project tutorial for learning typescripts in react the link is in the description below and until next time my name is James Charlesworth and this is the train to

{"channelName":"Train To Code","videoTitle":"Why Developers Are Switching to AWS CDK","transcript":"if you spend time on the internet of course you do then you might have seen more and more people recommending the AWS cdk and it's true the AWS Cloud development kit or cdk is rapidly growing in popularity so in this video we're going to look at what it is why it exists and how you can use it to build infrastructure in code but first a bit of History the story of aws's cloud development kit began only a few years ago in the late 2010s AWS was already a giant in cloud computing and developers around the world were deploying and managing their Cloud infrastructure through services like AWS cloud formation cloud formation is aws's native infrastructure as code service and it lets you write Json or yaml templates that describe what backend resources your application needs in the cloud so you can create them without having to click about in the AWS console which isn't particularly scalable for many Engineers though cloud formation with its long-winded templates it felt like writing novels to describe what could be drawn in a few diagrams developers really wanted a simpler more intuitive way to define the cloud environments using familiar programming Concepts abstractions were created on top of cloud formation to make it a bit more simple to use so things like serverless framework which I've talked a lot about on this channel in the past but also Sam which stands for serverless application model and that's kind of like a trimmed down streamlined abstraction over cloud formation but none of these were really gamechanging they just cut down a bit of the template code that you had to write you still had to write template code though which was a problem the initial idea for the cdk started internally at AWS as Engineers began to question what if we could write infrastructure code the way that we write application code this would mean using real programming languages with loops and conditionals and all the tools a developers love to create your AWS resources that way the development of the cdk wasn't a straightforward Journey though it needed a radical shift in thinking not just for AWS Engineers but for the global community that have been accustomed to this de cative nature of cloud formation and other iic templating tools like terraform because the CD essentially replaces lovely declarative templates with error prone sequential code it did need a bit of a culture shift but the AWS team carried on with it they saw a future where infrastructure could be treated with the same creativity and the same flexibility as any other software you might write so that makes Cloud development more accessible and a lot more flexible so to bring this Vision to life AWS assembled a team of Engineers who are not just Cloud experts but also passionate about developer experience they knew the cdk needed to be more than just an abstraction layer over cloud formation they'd already done that with the Sam it needed to actually be a bridge that spoke both the language of the infrastructure and the syntax of developers favorite programming languages so over a few months a team meticulously worked on an architecture they introduced constructs so constructs are the basic building blocks that developers could use to define their Cloud resources as code a construct looks like this it's basically a class in the objectoriented world the idea is that you create instances of a construct and that translates to creating a new instance of some service or some group of AWS services so like a Lambda function for example you create a Lambda function construct with all of your shared configuration and then you can create lots of instances of that to Define lots of AWS Lambda functions in 2019 AWS cdk was finally released to the world and it was met with a mix of curiosity and skepticism basically healthy skepticism I had after all developers had become used to thinking of infrastructure as static and mutable configurations cdk on the other hand was Dynamic and it breed this new kind of life into infrastructure definitions but the developer Community soon realized that they could actually write this in typescript in Python in Java or C and then build those AWS resources just like they were building say an API endpoint or something like that the cdk allowed for logical structures and reusable components and it made it feel as if Cloud infrastructure was evolving into software itself so today the AWS cdk is more than just a tool it's a whole new way of thinking about infrastructure it basically says infrastructure should be as agile as the application that it supports people now use it for projects that range from like simple serverless apis to massive microservices architectures there's a cdk construct Hub which is an online resource filled with open- Source constructs and it's contributed to by the community and that really serves as a testament to the widespread adoption that the AWS cdk has gotten now plus there's all the Reddit threads that Rave about it as well there is a learning curve to the AWS cdk though and I think this is a learning curve that's worth following so get subscribed to my channel here at train to code on YouTube over the next few weeks I'm going to be making a series of videos that show you how to build loads of different things in the AWS cdk I'll be using typescripts mainly but I'll also throw in a couple of videos on how to do this in C since I know a load of you that subscribe to my channel are C developers as well so if there's anything in particular that you'd like me to cover then pop a not in the comment section below and I'll see you in the next video which will be going on just next week so I'll see you there [Music]"}
{"channelName":"Train To Code","videoTitle":"Stop Trying to Learn By Memorizing Syntax","transcript":"so I've been working in Engineering Management for a number of years now and in that time I have interviewed a lot of software developers and you know a red flag that gives away somebody as perhaps not being such a strong candidate in a screening interview is when I ask you a technical question and you say you can't remember so for example if it's a front-end engineering interview I might casually ask you in conversation talk to me about how youd choose between flexbox and CSS grid and I'm asking that question because I want to see your thought process and I want to see how you articulate the pros and cons of each there's obviously no correct answer in a job interview but there is an incorrect answer and that's the one I hear a non-zero number of times the worst answer to this kind of question is oh sorry I can't remember that one I forgot like I'm not testing your memory I'm testing your skills and if that's the way that you approach software development interviews by trying to memorize a load of stuff as if you're going into an exam then you're doing yourself a disservice a software engineering interview is not an exam like you have at school school exams are indeed mainly about memorizing facts and being able to recall those facts in an examination scenario but for job interviews in this field in particular what we do is called a skills-based interview so as your interviewer I'm not looking for what facts you've memorized I actually don't care much at all about what you remember if you can't remember something that's fine I'm actually looking for what skills have you picked up in your experience so far this is why for example I've never had a problem with people Googling things during a job interview so I've had this situation before I was interviewing a candidate once in person and and we had a laptop on the table like this because we've been looking at their GitHub profile and I asked them a question about API design I think I asked them something about cause headers and the candidate pointed to the laptop and said I actually don't remember what those CS headers are but you mind if I quickly Google it I was like yeah of course you can Google it at least in my book that's absolutely fine other engineering managers might disagree but the way I see it I'm not testing your memory I'm testing your ability to solve a problem so if you can Google what HTTP headers you need for calls and come back to me with an answer that explains how you'd Implement that and what considerations you'd need to make then great that's a good answer that's how it works in practice essentially I don't care if you don't remember the names of those actual headers I mean who actually remembers the names of all the C headers right but I do care if you don't even know where to start because that shows inexperience so let's imagine a more tangible example with some code so let's say we're doing a coding interview like this and I give you this empty function and I ask you to reverse this string this input string here now one solution might be to create a resulting array of characters we'll call that result and then Loop through this string backwards so with I starting at input string. length greater than equals zero and then I minus minus push in input string at position I and then join that resulting array back up and return it as a string this is probably one of a hundred different ways you can solve this now if I gave you this problem in a job interview there's some parts of this that I'd expect you to know how to do just from experience but some parts of this you might need to Google so I'll probably expect you to know that you need to iterate backwards through this string somehow either with a loop or a map function or whatever you want to do I'd expect you to know that you would also need to assign some memory somewhere in your function to store the Reversed string so there's a bunch of ways you can do that but essentially that's it a loop to go backwards through the string and some memory that's the skill aspect of this problem I'm testing your ability to break this problem down into those individual steps and then maybe during the interview you know we'd have a conversation about the time and spatial complexity of doing it this way versus other ways you can do this there a lot of ways you can do this but what isn't a skill is remembering the Syntax for this decreasing Loop here right and that's the reason I chose this particular example of solution okay so you probably do know how to declare a for loop with an index of decreases like this but if you've forgotten this syntax you find yourself in a really high pressed job interview situation and your mind just goes blank and you just can't remember how to make this I variable decrease inside that for Loop then do you know what that's fine just say I know we need to iterate through the characters of this string and I know that we need to create a temporary avilable to S the results do you mind if I just Google the Syntax for creating this for Loop I'll be fine with that because your memory is not the skill that I'm testing for so yeah focus on building the skill to solve real world problems and focus on your ability to explain your thought process if you want to Outsource some of your memory to stack Overflow or Google or chat GPT then I'm actually fairly cool with that and you'll find that most hiring managers are cool with that too so next time you're preparing for a job interview stop worrying about remembering syntax or remembering acronyms or buzzwords or technology names focus on practicing the core programming skills and don't be afraid to ask the interviewer if you can Google some syntax or some terminology that you've forgotten so anyway I hope you found this video useful if you want to have some actual coding practice then I have a couple of recent videos on my channel that show you how to do some popular Elite code problems so you can check out one of those on the screen in this little box right now but until next time my name is James Charlesworth and this is train to code on YouTube"}
{"channelName":"Train To Code","videoTitle":"Why are people scared of generics?","transcript":"it's okay to say it some people are scared by generics just look at this code all those different colors and angle brackets everywhere what even is this function here trying to do this is the kind of thing that absolutely puts developers off of learning strongly typed languages such as typescript and it leads them to stick with something simpler like JavaScript but if you avoid type systems like this and you're actually missing out on quite a lot of great advantages to having a flexible and expressive code base so don't get intimidated I'm demystify all of this stuff for you today so it looks a lot more approachable first though what are generics generics are a feature that allow you to create classes interfaces and methods with a placeholder for the type of data that they store or use so this means the same class or method can operate on lots of different types of data so it's a bit like having a box or a container that can hold different types of objects the container Remains the Same but the objects that it can hold can vary generics are not not a concept that is exclusive to a single programming language they're found in many modern programming languages including Java C typescript and plenty of others each language implements generics in its own way but the core concept Remains the Same allowing for typesafe data structures and methods that can work with multiple types one common way that generics are used is in the creation of collection classes like lists or dictionaries or cues so here's an implementation of a q in typescript you can see the Q has this T parameter after the class declaration here so this means our Q can act on any object of any type and you specify what type the objects are when you create an instance of that que the t is being used in the functions down inside this class so for example the NQ function that takes an argument of that generic type T making the Q generic like this enables it to be type safe ensuring that only specified type of data can be stored in this Quee so that reduces runtime errors without generic you wouldd either have to accept any in here and then you lose all of the benefits of typescript or you'd have to implement different versions of this queue for different object types like a string queue and an integer cue and stuff like that despite these benefits some developers do find generics intimidating one of the reasons for this is that generics introduce a level of abstraction that can be complex to understand at first abstraction in programming refers to the concept of hiding complex implementation details behind a simpler interface to understand this better let's consider an everyday example think of a car you don't need to know the intricate workings of the engine in order to be able to drive the car you just need to know how to operate the steering wheel the pedals and the gears the complex details are abstracted away so similarly generics abstract away the specifics of the types and allow you just to focus on the logic of the code inside your functions so now let's look at some generics in typescript in a bit more detail here's a simple example of a generic function in typescript script this identity function has a generic type variable of T it takes an argument of type T and returns a value of type T back you can call this function with any type you like and it will return a value of that same type so for instance calling identity with number in there and then 100 will return a number while identity with string hello will return a string this example illustrates how generics can provide flexibility while maintaining that type safety that's so important the function works for any type but it still enforces that the input and the output are of the same type so you can put a type in here but you can't put in one type and get a different type out so this is still very much better than using any in types scope like this with any you can also pass in any types of the function but we lose that check that forces the function to return the same thing back in fact we lose all type checking completely which I kind of defeats the point of typescript but generics don't really stop there most languages that support generics like typescript they allow you to do extra stuff with them such as restrict which types can be used as your generic parameter in typescript this is done with the extends keyword to understand significance of extends in the context of generics let's consider another example imagine you have a function that's supposed to work with objects having a specific structure such as objects with a particular property like this without any constraints generics would accept any type which might lead them to runtime errors if they pass the object that doesn't have that required property so this is where extends comes into play the extends keyword in typescript generics allows us to specify a constraint that that generic type must adhere to so it's like setting rules or guidelines for What types are permissible by this function so this ensures that generic functions or classes can only be used with types that meet a set of criteria that we've specified and that enhances type safety and predictability so in this example we're saying that the type T must be any type that has a name property on it because the function uses that name property so one more example then typescript suppose we want to create a function that takes an object and a property name and then it Returns the value of the property from the object so we can use generics along with the extends keyword to ensure that the object actually contains a property specified in this function T is a generic type that extends object meaning that it can be any object and then K is another generic type that extends key of T so that's the set of property names in T So this ensures that the key argument passing to the function is guaranteed to be a key in that object for example if we have an object person with properties name and age we can use the get property function to safely retrieve the value of these properties in this case calling get property person name returns Alice which is the name and get property person age returns 30 but trying to access a property that doesn't exist like get property person not found that will result in a typescript compilation error and that's because the extends constraint is ensuring that only keys of that specific object are accepted by that second parameter so by defining type constraints like this we can ensure that the generic code we write is not only reusable but also sticks to the type requirements that we've set up and that prevents potential runtime errors and type mismatches generics aren't just an academic concept or some Niche feature of programming languages they have significant practical applications in everyday programming and being able to read and understand what generics are doing will make you a better developer generics enable you to write flexible and reusable code while maintaining strict type safety and this is particularly beneficial in large scale applications where maintaining code quality and avoiding type related bugs is really really important a real world use for generics is in develop of utility functions and libraries so for example data handling functions that operate on arrays or objects can be made generic to to work with any type of data so this makes our code more modular and it reduces the need for duplicating the code for different data types another practical application is in the context of API responses when interacting with apis the response data can vary in structure so generics allow us to Define types for those different responses that can be reused across different API calls so that ensures our handling of the response data is type safe and consistent and we can share a lot of code but different requests come back so anyway I hope you found this video useful as always please do subscribe to my channel and check out train
